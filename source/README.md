# ACT I

A small cell. A solid looking metal door, a red light glows above it. An empty bowl sits on the floor.

You are a green humanoid.

Task: Take the spoon from the empty food tray.
Task: Use the spoon with a crack in the wall. You get fine dust scrapings.

A voice booms through the door:

    MONSTER!
    TIME FOR THE TESTS, MONSTER!
    
The door clacks unlocked, the light turns green. Door slides open. 

Two guards enter. They hold what looks like stun guns.

    GUARD: MOVE IT, MONSTER.
    
Task: Use the cement dust on one of the guards. You throw it in their face, you shift to look like a guard.

    GUARD RUBS EYES: OH SHIT...
    OTHER GUARD: IT'S HIM! HE'S THE MONSTER!
    YOU: NO, HE IS THE MONSTER!
    GUARD: NO! I AM A GUARD!
    YOU: I AM A GUARD!
    FIRST GUARD: ONE OF YOU IS THE MONSTER...
                 LUCKILY WE HAVE DEVISED A QUESTION IN CASE THIS EVER HAPPENED!
                 YOU!...
    YOU: ME?
    FG: YES YOU... WHAT DOES 5, 7, 11 AND 13 HAVE IN COMMON?
    YOU: THEY ARE ALL... UM... NUMBERS?
    FG: CORRECT! THAT MEANS THE OTHER ONE IS THE MONSTER!
    GUARD: NO! I AM THE REAL GUARD!
    FG: EXACTLY WHAT A MONSTER WOULD SAY!
        (walks up to other guard)
    FG: MOVE IT!
    GUARD: (PUTS HANDS UP) YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE! (TURNS AROUND)
    YOU: I DON'T THINK SO! LOCK THAT MONSTER AWAY, GUARD!
    FG: MY PLEASURE!
        (GUARD ONE WALKS GUARD TWO THROUGH THE CELL DOOR. IT CLANKS CLOSED.)
        (WALKS BACK TO YOU)
    FG: GO TELL THE SCIENTISTS OF THIS INCIDENT.
